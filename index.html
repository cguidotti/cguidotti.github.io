                        I was born in Bologna, IT in 1999. After joining a scientific lyceum, I graduated from it in
                        2017. Currently, I'm studying for the main Computer Science course at <em>Università di Bologna</em>. In addition, I
                        occasionally work in the family company <em>Analysis</em>, which works mainly on a CRM called
                        <em>QualiWare</em>. I like working on digital applications because my dream is to create useful
                        software frameworks which should help people in dealing with business management, daily life
                        problems and environmental issues.

                    I'm still at the beginning, so I haven't developed any interesting project yet. However, during
                    university periods, I
                    contributed to a couple of projects, and I'm working on another one at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first one I worked on was a very raw videogame called <em>Non-Gravitar</em>, similar to the
                    world famous <em>Space Invaders</em>. It was entirely written in C++ and I used SFML for the
                    graphics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second project to which I have contributed was a set of applications useful for <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning">gamification of learning</a> and
                    made in order to build games to entertain children at museums. The set of applications were coded
                    using
                    JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The back-end part was written for NodeJS and used Express.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently working on another JavaScript project called <em>Tweet tracker</em>. The goal of this
                    application is to aggregate a set of tweets (basing on an hashtag, a username or a keyword) and
                    build a series of dashboards showing its data and metadata. Currently we are thinking of maps (using
                    Twitter's geolocation feature), bar charts, pie charts and word clouds. We are using React, Leaflet
                    and React Google Charts for the front-end part and NodeJS and Express for the back-end, while Axios
                    is being used in both parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the family company, I usually work on customized VB.NET forms used by our customers on their own
                    instance of QualiWare (the main application which we mantain).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is also part of a learning project, in this case for an online course. It has been made
                    in a couple of days with only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5.
